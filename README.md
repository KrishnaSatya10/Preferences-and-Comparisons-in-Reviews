# preferences-and-comparisons-in-reviews

User generated content on the internet, like blogs, product reviews, and user forums are a rich source of diverse opinions on a wide range of topics. Online user reviews on products often
contain comparisons (with rival products) that provide a more fine-grained insight about user preferences.
The task of this assignment is identifying user preferences and comparisons in product reviews by performing:
1. Comparative Sentence Identification (CSI): Given a sentence determine whether it contains comparison between two entities, and
2: Comparative Preference Classification (CPC): Identifying the preferred entity in a comparative sentence containing two entities being
compared.
The dataset comprises of online user reviews for comparative software products (apps and web-services).
